# MonitoringCO
Monitoring Carbon Monoxide(CO) Position with MQ-7 Sensor and KNN Method
This project use Arduino Uno R3 as main microcontroler to detect the amount of Carbon Monoxide(CO) using MQ-7 Sensor, 
and NodeMCU Esp8266 as the secondary to process the data from Arduino with KNN Method to get the CO position, 
this project also connected with InfluDB Database and Grafana for its output display.
